# Aura

**An out-of-body ambisonic experience.**

Aura is a work-in-progress demo of a 3D puzzle-platformer made with the Unity Engine. It utilizes a traditional first-person controller as well as a second-person spatial audio controller.

What does this mean, exactly?

In Aura, you have the ability to switch between two characters - one from a first person viewpoint and one that is viewed in the second person through the lens of the first. This second controller, your *Aura*, acts as your ears while your body acts as your eyes. Through utilizing both of these controllers carefully, you'll be able to solve puzzles that require your eyes to be in one place and your ears in another.
